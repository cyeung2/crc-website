          The Chicago Recycling Coalition presents a new paper, entitled "Recycling Policies in Chicago and Beyond: Failures in Information Collection and Provision," by Professor Matthew Shapiro (IIT) and Graduate Student Matt Lithgow (DePaul)
          October 9, 2015
        </p>

        <p>
          This paper assesses and evaluates the existing recycling metrics for Chicago and other comparable municipalities. The patchwork system of Chicago’s recycling collection limits our ability to calculate an accurate recycling rate for the city, and this is a function of the city’s limited access to and provision of recycling data. Municipalities must establish policies that make sense, enact laws that embody those policies, create a framework for accountability, and actually hold residents and businesses accountable. To this end, Chicago must provide recycling and composting services to everyone, recycling must be tracked and the attendant data must be made readily available, and its educational initiatives must be overhauled in order to decrease contamination of the recycling stream.
